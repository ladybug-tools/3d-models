Ladybug Web 3D Models Read Me
===

## [Ladybug Web 3D Models Viewer]( http://ladybug-analysis-tools.github.io/3d-models/ )

A collection of 3d models of buildings.

See the home page for the details

Everyone: create a readme.json file and add a thumbnail for each model. We will use later to make a visual web-based dashboard for your models.


## Licensing

Currently the work herein is under the MIT license

But consideration should be given to a dual license - either MIT or GPL

And furthermore, the models here are content much more than code, therefore a Creative Commons license may be appropriate

## Issues

Probably a majority of the files that you can view here had issues the first time they were opened by one of the scripts.
Each of these issues has been used to improve the process.
The more models we can access, the more issues we will find and the better we will get
