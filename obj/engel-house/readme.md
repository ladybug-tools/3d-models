From the article:

> Buildings were raised on pillars (pilotis), the first being the 1933 Engel House designed by Zeev Rechter. These allow the wind to blow under and cool the apartments, as well as providing a play area for children. 



### &#128279; [Bauhaus in Tel Aviv ]( http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000020552.htm )

From the article

>Stilt Columns (Pilotis) 
>Another element used by Le Corbusier was stilt-type columns (pilotis), which raised the buildings off street level thereby creating room for a green garden area while providing greater airflow.

> The first building built in this manner in Tel Aviv, was Beit Engel. It was built in 1933, by Zeev Rechter, and is located at 84 Rothschild Boulevard, and the corner of Ma’zeh Street. Rothschild Boulevard is an excellent area to see a great variety of Bauhaus buildings (although quite a few are in dire need of restoration). If you go to see the Engel building today you will notice that the ‘open’ area created by the stilt columns has been enclosed. Rechter fought for two years to get approval to build on these stilt columns. This type of building became quite common, in Tel Aviv and the surrounding cities, although by the 1940’s fewer buildings were being built in this manner in Tel Aviv.



### &#128279; [Domus Tour Tel-Aviv Tour]( send-to.html#http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2010/06/07/tel-aviv-archi-tour.html )

From the article:
> Slightly further up Sderot Rothschild we come upon the Angel House, the fruit of Tel Aviv's very first encounter with Modernism. 
> "The first building in the city to rest on an open storey of supporting columns", a plaque reads, "was inspired by the architect Le Corbusier", and built just 5 years after the completion of Ville Savoye. 
> The architect is Zeev Rechter, father of Jacob Rechter - the author of the pavilions where our tour began. 

> Few traces of the building's former Modernist glory remain today. 
> The ground floor has been largely walled up, probably to serve as a shelter during the many conflicts that have wracked the city since the twenties, and the upper floors, although inhabited, are in a state of disrepair; nevertheless, there is a romantic beauty to decaying modernism that arguably equals a pristine renovation in its appeal. 
>Buildings such as this one, Joshua tells us, are today frequently the property of a slew of heirs, making restoration difficult.
