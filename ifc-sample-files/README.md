# IFC Read Me

## Models

# Concept

* IFC is an emerging AEC standard
* [industry foundation classes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes ) ((IFC) is an open and neutral data format for [building information modeling]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ) (BIM).
* There is an existing mix of proprietary, closed source apps and open source apps, but most require a download and install
* The choice of FOSS web-based apps is very limited
* Mobile 3D viewing apps for IFC seem almost non-existent

_all of the above needs confirming_

### Mission

* Build lightweight IFC apps that work in your browser
* Provide interactive 3D views
* Entry level code accessible/hackable by engineers and architects
    * Build custom apps for day-to-day needs quickly and easily
* Read IFC data and directly generate 3D - no translations or intermediate formats


### Vision

* Basic IFC property editing capability
* Just-in-time viewing based on streaming or gradual loading of different layers - instead of loading everything at once.
* Ability to Redline IFC models
* 3D project management

## Issues

* 2016-11-07 ~ Need help in finding a glossary of IFC terms for dummies that loads reasonably quickly
