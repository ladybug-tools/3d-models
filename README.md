Use this script to browse, view and interact with the files in 3D:

## [Ladybug Tools / Spider Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2021/spider-viewer )

This repository hosts a collection of 3d models that relate to architect, engineering and construction (AEC).



## Licensing

Currently the work herein is under the MIT license

But consideration should be given to a dual license - either MIT or GPL.

And furthermore, the models here are content much more than code, therefore a Creative Commons license may be appropriate

## Issues

Probably a majority of the files that you can view here had issues the first time they were opened by one of the scripts.

Each of these issues has been used to improve the process.

The more models we can access, the more issues we will find and the better we will get


## To-do

* Add links to NASA files and other large repos of 3D models
* Bring over Jaanga & FGX files



## Links of Interest

Looking at 3D models in your browser can be a lot of fun. And there are a lot of tools available for viewing files.

Here is a look at different file types and viewers. Currently, we are mostly looking a free, online open source services that are not trying to sell you something.
