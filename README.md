# [![](https://pushme-pullyou.github.io/tootoo-2021/lib/assets/icons/mark-github.svg )](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/3d-models/ "Source code on GitHub" )  [Ladybug Tools / 3D Models Read Me]( https://ladybug.tools/3d-models/#README.md)

Use this script to view and interact with the files in 3D:

## [Ladybug Tools / Spider Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2021/spider-viewer )

This repository hosts a collection of 3d models that relate to architect, engineering and construction (AEC).

Currently the left menu set to recognize these file types:  "gif", "md", "jpg", "html", "license", "pdf", "png", "svg", "txt". Other file types may or may not be displayed as text.

A future version of the left menu will enable to view files in 3D. In the meantime you can use the [Spider Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2021/spider-viewer ).


## Licensing

Currently the work herein is under the MIT license

But consideration should be given to a dual license - either MIT or GPL.

And furthermore, the models here are content much more than code, therefore a Creative Commons license may be appropriate

## Issues

Probably a majority of the files that you can view here had issues the first time they were opened by one of the scripts.

Each of these issues has been used to improve the process.

The more models we can access, the more issues we will find and the better we will get
