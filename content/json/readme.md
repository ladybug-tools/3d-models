[JSON Files Read Me]( index.html )

The menu for this folder uses the GitHub API to obtain the names of all the folders under this folder.
If any folder contains a readme file then it is added to this menu.
This ability allows you to add files without having to edit menus - which is handy when there are large numbers of files moving in and out of folders.
